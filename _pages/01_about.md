### 1) To evaluate if recurrent taxonomic and functional bacterioplankton successions related to algal blooms observed at the German Bight also occur at the Uruguayan Atlantic coast.
### 2) To unveil the mechanisms behind these succession patterns.
### 3) To compare taxonomy-based vs trait-based statistical models in their power of predicting ecosystem functions (DOM degradation patterns and ecosystem metabolic balance).
